What's this project about?
For this assignment, you will
Choose a security-related topic that fascinates you.
Enter your topic and team on this Google spreadsheet.
Produce a website introducing your audience (i.e. the other students in this class) to the topic.
As appropriate for your topic, include historical background, technical explanations, implications for people (e.g. legal/privacy/practical/ethical/financial implications), etc. Whatever subtopics are relevant for your topic, you should favor digging deep into one or two subtopics over providing a shallow, broad overview.
