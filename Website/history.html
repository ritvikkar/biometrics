                        <p><br>The term “biometrics” is derived from the Greek words “bio” (life) and “metrics” (to measure). Electronic biometric systems have been implemented over the past few decades however these techniques are based off ideas conceived thousands of years ago. <br> <br>
                        Caves as old as 31,000 years old show paintings with handprints of the artist as a form of signature. Fingerprints were believed to be marks of human identity as far back as 500 B.C. Modern biometrics emerged in the mid-1800 with the rise of the industrial evolution. Merchants and local authorities could no longer rely on knowing local merchants and fingerprinting because a way of identifying people. The justice system also started to evolve and began to treat first time offenders differently than repeat offenders. <br> <br>
                        Police in France developed the Bertillon System, recording arm-length, height and other body measurements to recognize prior criminals. By the late 1800s index fingerprints provided a more accurate and efficient replacement to the Bertillon System.  The first large scale application of this was in India, developed by Azizul Haque for Edward Henry, Inspector General of Police, Bengal, India. This system came to be called the Henry system and is still in use today. Electronic Biometrics only began to emerge in the latter half of the twentieth century, along the emergence of computer systems. <br> <br>
                        With the wide spread of technology, biometric information can be shared across platforms and locations and therefore more commonly used for identification. Fingerprinting became affordable, predictable, hand improved making it the most commonly used biometric publicly used. Apple and Samsung brought this technology to the public domain by integrating it in their phones. </p>
