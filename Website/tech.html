                        <h1>Spoofing - Technological</h1>
                        <p>The other 7 points of attack on a finger print scanner are much more complex and technological.<br> <br>
                        2. <b> Bypassing to sensor to resubmit previously stored digitized biometrics signals. </b><br>
                        In order to attack the system at this point, the attacker would need to submit an old copy of a finger print image and pass it off as data from the scanner. <br> <br>
                        3. <b>Overriding the feature extraction process </b> <br>
                        To override the feature extraction process, a Trojan horse would be used that makes the feature extraction process produce features predetermined by the attacker. This way any finger print could be passed off as the correct finger print as long as the feature extraction process produces the features that the matcher will be looking for. <br> <br>
                        4. <b>Tampering with the biometric feature representation after extraction </b> <br>
                        After the features are extracted, instead of overriding before this process, the attacker can override the results and change what the results are. Attacks at this point in the verification process are very difficult because the stages of feature extraction and matches are often inseparable, so changing data between the steps is quite difficult. The best way to go about doing this type of attack would be to “snoop” on the TCP/IP stack and alter the packets in the case that information is transmitted to a remote matcher over the internet. <br> <br>
                        5. <b> Corrupting the matcher </b><br>
                        The matcher can be corrupted, especially if it is a remote matcher, so that it only returns the preselected match scores for the finger print—labelling every finger print a match. This can also be done so only certain fingerprints yield a match even though they are not. <br> <br>
                        6. <b>Tampering with stored templates used by the matcher </b><br>
                        The matcher uses templates that are either remote or local and possible on multiple servers in order to produce a match. These can be manipulated in order to make the matcher determine an incorrect fingerprint a match or deny a correct one. <br> <br>
                        7. <b>Attacking the channel between the stored templates and the matcher </b><br>
                        The templates themselves do not need to be manipulated. Since the templates are sent through a communication channel, the templates can be intercepted and modified en route to the matcher. <br> <br>
                        8. <b>Overriding the final decision </b><br>
                        The last possible point of attack is the final decision. The attacker can override this final decision that the matcher came to whether or not everything else so far in the process was wrong. If the final decision is not secure, the entire process of the fingerprint scanner, even if extremely accurate, becomes pointless. <br> <br>
